# Linkedin-Profile-Scrapper
# Web-Scraping-Project
The objective of this project was to explore the data related job market and it's requirements within the industry. Also, I wanted to gain more knowledge and experience in web-scraping.

LinkedIn is an American company established in 2002. They created a platform for the social media of professional networking. This platform is mainly used for professional networking which includes  employers posting jobs and job seekers posting their resumes or CVs. Eventually most of LinkedIn's revenue started coming from selling access to information about its members to recruiters and sales professionals. As of 2019, LinkedIn has 610 million registered members in 200 countries. Of these users more than 250 million are active.

I wrote a python scripts, to responsibly scrape the LinkedIn website in which it gathers information from each profile link.
